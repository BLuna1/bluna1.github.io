    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>There is a high chance that there is something in the box. There is something that stores water within it.</p>
    <h1>Evidence </h1>
    <p>The Mystery Black Box is what its name implies with a funnel at the top and a spout at the bottom. Once water is poured through the funnel water would come out the bottom but different amounts of water would come out. First thing that came to mind was that something was storing water. After many tests on the real black box it overflowed and caused water to leak from the bottom. Other times when the box was tilted to the side and forward much more water came out. Sometimes nothing would come out at all.  </p>
