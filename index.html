    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>There is a high chance that there is something in the box. There is something that stores water within it.</p>
    <h1>Evidence </h1>
    <p>The Mystery Black Box is what its name implies with a funnel at the top and a spout at the bottom. Once water is poured through the funnel water would come out the bottom but different amounts of water would come out. First thing that came to mind was that something was storing water. After many tests on the real black box it overflowed and caused water to leak from the bottom. Other times when the box was tilted to the side and forward much more water came out. Sometimes nothing would come out at all. We Made and tested so we could understand how the mystery black box works just a little more. Once my group created a prototype we weren't able to do many tests but based on the test on the big black box and the few tests we did on our prototype </p>    
    <h1>Reasoning Part II </h1>
    <p> Making a black box model could help us understand how the actual black box works. We make models to scale so we can grasp how something is built or how something  functions. Models are very useful to explain how different parts of an object looks like and how it functions. A model may not be an exact replica of an object that just makes it a recreation.
